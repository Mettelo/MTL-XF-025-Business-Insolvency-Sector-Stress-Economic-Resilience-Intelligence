# MTL-XF-025 — Required deliverables

**Commissioned decision:** Which sectors or recorded geographic concentrations of company insolvency warrant business-support investigation, after distinguishing count growth, coverage and insolvency procedures?

All locations below refer to the team's delivery repository. The master repository defines the requirements and contains no completed analysis. Owners are assigned from [the project roles](PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

## D1 — Discovery & decision requirements

**Due:** Week 1  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/01-discovery/`

Decision statement; stakeholder map; as-is reporting to investigation-review process; at least eight prioritised requirements. Answer these questions: Which insolvency procedures drive recent changes within each jurisdiction? Which sectors concentrate observed records, where industry coding exists? Are recorded geographic concentrations robust to missing or ambiguous addresses? Do recent trends persist under three- versus six-month smoothing? What business-population denominator and support-service evidence are needed before an early-warning claim?

**Acceptance evidence:** All requirements have an owner, priority, deliverable and test ID; domain analyst approves scope.

## D2 — Governed sources & cohort

**Due:** Week 2  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/02-data-governance/; data/`

Freeze the June 2026 long-run CSV and England/Wales/Scotland record-level ZIP. National trends use the long-run history from 2000 to the actual frozen endpoint. Record-level sector/geography analysis uses only the coverage and fields documented inside that ZIP; do not assume the entire long-run history is represented. Register exact files, metadata, licences, checksums, coverage and critical fields; record rejection of unavailable dimensions.

**Acceptance evidence:** 100% of inputs registered; no claimed freeze until acquisition evidence exists.

## D3 — Reproducible analytical model

**Due:** Week 3  
**Team artefact location:** `src/; sql/; docs/03-data-model/`

National fact: month × jurisdiction × procedure × adjustment basis. Record fact: published insolvency event/record × event date × jurisdiction × available company/sector/geography fields. A company identifier need not uniquely identify an insolvency event. Deliver load, type checks, hierarchy handling, lineage, exclusions and environment instructions.

**Acceptance evidence:** A second member regenerates equivalent curated outputs from identical inputs; no unexplained duplicate analytical keys.

## D4 — Quality & reconciliation

**Due:** Week 3  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/04-data-quality/; tests/`

Profile missingness, suppression, valid values, keys and join coverage. Reconcile five monthly/procedure measures without combining seasonally adjusted and unadjusted values. Show a repeated company ID with different valid events is not blindly deduplicated. Quantify missing industry/geography records before any concentration calculation. Test that a missing month invalidates a three-month moving window rather than becoming zero.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every input row is accounted for as retained, excluded or quarantined; five published cells reconcile within declared rounding.

## D5 — KPI catalogue

**Due:** Week 4  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/05-kpi-catalogue/`

Define all 8 measures listed below with formula, grain, denominator, unit, source fields, exclusions, owner, refresh and limitations.

**Acceptance evidence:** 100% headline metrics trace to source fields and tested transformations; conditional unavailable measures are explicitly marked.

## D6 — Domain analytical assessment

**Due:** Week 5  
**Team artefact location:** `analysis/; docs/06-analysis/`

Produce procedure/jurisdiction trends separating seasonal adjustment bases and registration dates. Analyse industry and geography only where the record-level fields support them; quantify unmatched and uncoded records.

**Acceptance evidence:** At least five evidence-backed findings state period, population, comparison, magnitude, uncertainty and limitation; negative findings count.

## D7 — Investigation decision framework

**Due:** Week 6  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/07-decision-framework/`

Shortlist up to ten sector/geographic investigation cases with three-/six-month sensitivity and explicit denominator gaps. Record eligibility, thresholds, weights if used, reason codes and manual review triggers.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every shortlisted case has metrics, rationale, owner and evidence gaps; at least two scenarios compared; fewer than ten is valid where evidence is insufficient.

## D8 — BI decision-support product

**Due:** Draft Week 6; final Week 7  
**Team artefact location:** `dashboard/`

Executive overview answering 'Which sectors or recorded geographic concentrations of company insolvency warrant business-support investigation, after distinguishing count growth, coverage and insolvency procedures?' plus diagnostic and data-quality views; visible periods, units, denominator notes, resettable filters and accessible labels.

**Acceptance evidence:** Five headline measures reconcile; every filter tested; export screenshots/PDF plus reproducible build or free access instructions.

## D9 — Independent assurance & UAT

**Due:** Week 7  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/08-assurance-uat/`

At least ten scenarios including the four project-specific tests below; requirement-to-test matrix, expected/actual evidence, defect log and simulated stakeholder feedback.

**Acceptance evidence:** No unresolved critical/high defect; accepted lower-severity limitations have a named reviewer and explicit impact.

## D10 — Technical & operational handover

**Due:** Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/09-technical-handover/`

Clean setup, architecture, frozen input manifest, run/refresh steps, output checks, troubleshooting and change-control process for Business Insolvency, Sector Stress & Economic Resilience Intelligence.

**Acceptance evidence:** Another member reproduces the core outputs without undocumented edits and records environment, duration and discrepancies.

## D11 — Executive recommendation

**Due:** Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `deliverables/`

Maximum two-page briefing and 15–20 minute presentation: commissioned decision, five findings, investigation shortlist, sensitivity, missing evidence, responsibilities and next review.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every quantitative claim links to an artefact/metric; no unsupported causal, policy or operational guarantee.

## D12 — Contribution & delivery record

**Due:** Weekly; final Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md; delivery issues/PRs`

Record who delivered and reviewed each MTL-XF-025 work package, including domain, governance, engineering, BI and assurance contributions.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every member links to substantive artefacts and review/presentation evidence; commit count alone is insufficient.

## Required KPI definitions

| Metric | Required definition / calculation |
| --- | --- |
| Monthly insolvency events | Published count by procedure, jurisdiction and adjustment basis. |
| Year-on-year change | 100 × (monthly count / same month previous year − 1), only with positive comparable base. |
| Three-month moving count | Trailing three-month sum; require all three months. |
| Procedure share | 100 × procedure count / compatible jurisdiction total. |
| Observed sector share | 100 × coded sector events / all observed eligible events; display uncoded share separately. |
| Geographic coding coverage | 100 × valid mapped records / eligible record-level records. |
| Record-to-series reconciliation gap | Record aggregate minus compatible published count; report scope and timing differences. |
| Concentration | Sum of squared sector shares at a declared mutually exclusive industry level; report uncoded treatment. |

For every metric record business purpose, formula, source fields, grain, unit, numerator/denominator, exclusions, suppression, zero-base behaviour, owner, refresh and test evidence. Do not populate conditional metrics from invented fields.

## Mandatory domain scenarios

1. Reconcile five monthly/procedure measures without combining seasonally adjusted and unadjusted values.
2. Show a repeated company ID with different valid events is not blindly deduplicated.
3. Quantify missing industry/geography records before any concentration calculation.
4. Test that a missing month invalidates a three-month moving window rather than becoming zero.

## Review gates

Week 2: cohort and source approval. Week 4: model, DQ and metrics approval. Week 6: analytical and decision-framework review. Week 8: UAT, independent rerun and final panel review. Record reviewer, date, artefact version and decision at every gate.
